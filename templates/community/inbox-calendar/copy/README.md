# Copy

Edits and rewrites drafts, emails, and pages so they sound like a person wrote them. Keeps your voice, shows every change and why, and never invents a fact.

## Use it in Pi

```bash
cp -r templates/community/inbox-calendar/copy ~/pi-bots/copy && cd ~/pi-bots/copy
pi --approve   # trust the folder: loads AGENTS.md, .pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md, skills/, prompts/
```

Or install only the skills and routine prompts: `pi install ./templates/community/inbox-calendar/copy`. The persona in `AGENTS.md` applies only when you run Pi inside the folder.

## What was converted

| Grok Bot | Pi |
| --- | --- |
| Profile / persona | `AGENTS.md`, `.pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` |
| Memory (4) | `MEMORY.md` |
| Skills (0) | `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, full bodies |
| Routines (1) | `prompts/<name>.md` (`/name`), verbatim text in `routines/`, schedule sketches in `cron/` and `systemd/` |
| Plugins (0) | `CONNECTORS.md`, `connectors.json` |

### Routine schedules

- `/weekly-shipped-check`: cron `0 15 * * 5` (found in the template text)

## What did not translate

- Grok Bot runtime features: shared box computer/browser desktop, Grok channels (Slack/iMessage/email send-as), team multi-bot wake, built-in X/Grok data tools.
- Routine scheduling and event triggers: Pi has no scheduler; see `prompts/`, `cron/`, `systemd/`.

Content belongs to the original creator; this is an automated format conversion for personal use with Pi.
